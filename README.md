# BharatInternTasks
This a repository that are the machine learning tasks assigned to me under the Bharat Intern Scheme
It contains two tasks that is the 
House Price Prediction and the
Iris Classification

From the House Price Prediction task i learnt about the tensorflow model Sequential, and also about Label encoding and from the second task i discovered more on the neural network creation and training using the tensorflow module.
